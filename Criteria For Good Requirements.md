Good requirements should meet the following characteristics:
* Unambiguous - There should be only one way to interpret a requirement
* Testable (verifiable) - Testers should be able to verify whether the requirement is implemented correctly. The test should either pass or fail. To be testable, requirements should be clear, precise, and unambiguous.
* Clear (concise, terse, simple, precise).
* Correct.
* Understandable.
* Feasible (realistic, possible) - doable within existing constraints such as time, money, and available resources.
* Independent - To understand the requirement, there should not be a need to know any other requirement or refer to any other documents.
* Atomic - The requirement should contain a single traceable element.
* Necessary - None of the stakeholders needs the requirement, or removing the requirement will not affect the system.
* Implementation-free (abstract) - requirements should not contain unnecessary design and implementation information.

Besides these criteria for individual requirements, three criteria apply to the set of requirements. The set should be:
* Consistent - There should not be any conflicts between the requirements
* Nonredundant - Each requirement should be expressed only once and should not overlap with another requirement.
* Complete - A requirement should be specified for all conditions that can occur.
